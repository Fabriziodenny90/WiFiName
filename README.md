WiFiName
========

Menu Bar app for Mac OS to display current WiFi connection's name. This can help the user to constantly monitor the WiFi connection and detect possible auto-reconnection done by the Mac to unwanted networks.

To close the App: ctrl+click on the WiFi's name.

Still trying to make it possible to reposition the app along the Menu Bar.

I own the material in this repository. If you like my idea and would like to help improving it, contact me.

Cheers
